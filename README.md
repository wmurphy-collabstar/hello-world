# hello-world: Learning how to use Github
I am an intermediate programmer and web developer. I'm *happy* to know that software development *is* a passion for me, including the **coding and design process**. 

I want to keep learning new things, and I believe in myself. 

In 2019, I was pretty pessimistic since I was brand new to the tech field, but I know now that I can pursue my goal of being a full-time Web Developer. 

**You've *got* this!!**
